My final project is about a person collecting coins and dogding fireballs. 

Instructions:
- Use W, A, S, D to move the person
- Collect coins
- Collect Health bottles to heal Health
- Dodge fireballs

Goal: Get as many coins before you die

Features:
- Fireballs deal damage to health
- Fireballs speed up by 1 every 5 coins
- Health bottles can heal the person by 1 health point but cannot heal over 5
- Each coin is worth 1 point and is listed at the bottome left corner in game
- Boundaries are placed so the person cannot go out of the area (black lines)
- Can restart game once the person dies by pressing space
